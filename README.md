# ABOUT
This project has three parts.
In the first part we create a random data set using the random module in python. This data set consists of three variables per vector quantity: weight, height an gender. 100 such 3 dimensional vectors are generated.
The data set thus created is then stored as a csv file.
Second step consists of calculating the BMI( body mass index) of each person(vector). 
Then we choose an arbitrary classifier in order to predict the genders based on the bmi(bmi>23 => male , female otherwise).
By comparing the labels and the predictions we calculate the risk of predicting male and female.
